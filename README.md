# basis.java
A computational basis for an Action-Format paradigm. Taking the idea of a Zome, as a List runner, and providing a solid execution firewall. The Format becomes a potential and Action becomes the kinetic. The Zome is a quanta, an energizer. The multitasking multithread situation, leads to a fundemental set of basis classes, to represent the desired machine in the self context.

This can be stated as a DEP nil nop situation. A code class stat could perhaps lead to auto selection of bus and register 'techture as the fundemental mem stat formats, and dyno core actions fit better on some. The modes of machine operation a binary, and a two bit protection lock for also zome and nil access at a hardware level. There is no protection fault, there is just slow nil.

## Lanterna
An excellent ncurses for Java kind of thing. I included it to develop on the model and make a simple CLI based editor. Why another editor you ask? Why not. It also gives me the chance to make some CLI tools, and replace some of my current IDE paradigm. I think it's worth some R&D.

## JSON Tools
Added in for the ubiquity of the format. This will be ideal for producing config files, and some general web connection in the code. I selected both these packages for the free and/or LGPL licences. It allows for further developments which are private, when used on their own. So be aware the MIT licence is for the classes starting **uk.co.kring** and those were the ones I wrote.
