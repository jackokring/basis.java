# basis.java
A computational basis for an Action-Format paradigm. Taking the idea of a Zome, as a List runner, and providing a solid execution
firewall. The Format becomes a potential and Action becomes the kinetic. The Zome is a quanta, an energizer. The multitasking
multithread situation, leads to a fundemental set of basis classes, to represent the desired machine in the self context.

This can be stated as a DEP nil nop situation. A code class stat could perhaps lead to auto selection of bus and register 'techture
as the fundemental mem stat formats, and dyno core actions fit better on some. The modes of machine operation a binary, and a two
bit protection lock for also zome and nil access at a hardware level. There is no protection fault, there is just slow nil.
