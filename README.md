# basis.java
A computational basis for an Action-Format paradigm. Taking the idea of a Zome, as a List runner, and providing a solid execution
firewall. The Format becomes a potential and Action becomes the kinetic. The Zome is a quanta, an energizer. The multitasking
multithread situation, leads to a fundemental set of basis classes, to represent the desired machine in the self context.
